## Dependencies
1. [Raspberry Pi 2](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/)
2. [Windows 10 IoT Core Preview](https://dev.windows.com/iot)
3. [Windows 10 Preview](https://insider.windows.com/)
4. [Visual Studio 2015](http://visualstudio.com/)

## Installing Windows 10 IoT Core
Head over to the Windows 10 IoT Core site and follow [the instructions there to get it installed on your micro SD card](http://ms-iot.github.io/content/en-US/win10/SetupRPI.htm). After you've put the card in the Pi it will start and reboot a few times before finally showing the [default app screen](http://ms-iot.github.io/content/images/DefaultAppRpi2.png). Be patient, this process will take a little while. Continue through the instructions to get the dev tools for Windows 10 IoT Core installed on your Windows 10 machine.
