**Description**:  
A raspberry pi based smart lock with strong cryptography. A cheap way to lock and unlock your doors.

## What you'll need
1. [Raspberry Pi 2](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/)
2. 2+ amp USB power pack and micro USB cable to power your Pi
3. HDMI cable and monitor so you can watch the status of your Pi while installing Windows 10 IoT Core
4. Micro SD card (8GB+) to install [Windows 10 IoT Core Preview](https://dev.windows.com/iot) on
5. Machine running [Windows 10 Preview](http://windowsinsider.com) & [Visual Studio 2015 RC](http://visualstudio.com/)
6. Physical network with a cable for both your Raspberry Pi 2 and your Windows 10 machine

## Installing Windows 10 IoT Core
Head over to the Windows 10 IoT Core site and follow [the instructions there to get it installed on your micro SD card](http://ms-iot.github.io/content/en-US/win10/SetupRPI.htm). After you've put the card in the Pi it will start and reboot a few times before finally showing the [default app screen](http://ms-iot.github.io/content/images/DefaultAppRpi2.png). Be patient, this process will take a little while. Continue through the instructions to get the dev tools for Windows 10 IoT Core installed on your Windows 10 machine.
